# Setting Up Jarvis on Glitch

This guide provides instructions for deploying Jarvis on Glitch.com, addressing common issues with package installation.

## Initial Setup

1. Create a new project on Glitch or remix an existing one
2. Upload your project files or use the Glitch console to clone your repository

## Package Installation Issues

If you encounter package installation errors with `requirements.txt`, try the following approaches:

### Approach 1: Use requirements-glitch.txt

```bash
pip install -r requirements-glitch.txt
```

This file contains more flexible version requirements that are compatible with Glitch's environment.

### Approach 2: Install Packages Individually

If the requirements file still causes issues, try installing packages individually:

```bash
pip install google-generativeai
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyttsx3
# Continue with other packages
```

### Approach 3: Use Package Alternatives

Some packages may not be available or may require system dependencies that are difficult to install on Glitch:

- For `PyAudio`: Consider using web-based audio alternatives if deploying a web interface
- For `webrtcvad`: This may require system libraries; consider disabling this feature on Glitch

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set up your environment variables in the Glitch project settings:

1. Go to your project's settings
2. Find the `.env` section
3. Add all the necessary API keys and configuration variables from your local `.env` file

## Starting the Application

Modify the start command in `package.json` or create one if it doesn't exist:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "python api.py"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check Glitch logs for specific error messages
2. Try downgrading problematic packages to versions known to work on Glitch
3. Consider removing non-essential dependencies for the Glitch deployment
